// Engine-specific candle model or extensions.
// As noted in the plan, core Candle model is in `shared::models::Candle`.
// This file might be for:
// 1. A struct that wraps `shared::models::Candle` and adds engine-specific metadata.
// 2. Traits or methods specific to how candles are processed or stored within the engine.
// 3. If the engine needs a slightly different internal representation for performance or other reasons.

// For now, keeping it minimal. If the engine solely uses `shared::models::Candle`,
// this file might not be strictly necessary, or `engine/src/models/mod.rs` could just re-export.

// Example: An engine-specific extension (illustrative)
/*
use shared::models::Candle as SharedCandle;

pub struct EngineCandle {
    pub shared: SharedCandle,
    pub processed_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    // other engine-specific fields
}

impl From<SharedCandle> for EngineCandle {
    fn from(shared_candle: SharedCandle) -> Self {
        EngineCandle {
            shared: shared_candle,
            processed_at: chrono::Utc::now(),
        }
    }
}
*/

// If no engine-specific extensions are immediately needed, this can be left empty,
// or the `engine/src/models/mod.rs` can directly use/re-export from `shared::models`.
// The spec included `engine/src/models/candle.rs` so creating the placeholder.
